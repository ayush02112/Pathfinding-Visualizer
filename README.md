## ✨ Features
- 🟢 Interactive grid (create walls, drag start & finish nodes).
- 🔍 Visualizes algorithms:
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - A* Search
- 🎨 Smooth animations for visited nodes and shortest path.
- 🧱 Wall creation and obstacle placement with mouse drag.
- 🔄 Clear board/reset functionality.
- ⚡ Built with **React + Tailwind CSS** for performance and modern UI.
